# Unnamed-Code
Game hosting website platform

Welcome to Unnamed, the new competitive online arcade. With the decay of flash video games, developers have turned to Javascript APIs such as WebGL. Sadly old arcade gaming websites have not updated with the times and began to fad away. Online arcades are no longer commonly known leaving an empty void for many gamers childhood memories. We seek to solve this by providing an updated platform for people to upload their video games, or compete for the top spot in the community leaderboard. The website is still in progress, but we hope to have it up and running soon.
